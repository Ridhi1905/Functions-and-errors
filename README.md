# Functions-and-errors
This solidity program is a simple program to find the division of numbers by the use of functions and for the errors we can get the error messages and all this is done using revert(), assert(), and require() statements.
# Description
In this solidity program we are going tp write a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.
# Getting Started
To run the program follow the steps:
1. Copy the code and paste it to remix-Ethereum IDE
2. Compile the contract with its same version of code or you can change it to the latest version
3. then deploy the contract 
4. enter the value of the numerator and denominator and transact it
5. you can see the divided value
